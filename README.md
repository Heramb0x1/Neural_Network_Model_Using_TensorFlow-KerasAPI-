# Neural_Network_Model_Using_TensorFlow-KerasAPI-
I Analyzed, Trained &amp; Created a Model containing local Data of a Dense Neural Network (DNN) from a local repository
Local Repository I Used : https://github.com/ammishra08/MachineLearning/blob/master/Datasets/insurance.csv

Here in the plotted graph, both mean squared error value and actual mse value must be Overlapping or intersection should be seen... 
i.e. It represents that model is well trained .. 
In My case, it isn't getting to see. In future I'll Update the code.. ðŸ˜‰
Suggestion :  To Train model better, epoch should be increased (if overlapping isn't seen)
